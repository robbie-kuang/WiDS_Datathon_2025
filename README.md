## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for the **WiDS Datathon 2025**, where the objective is to predict the sex and presence of ADHD from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) matrices. The task involves analyzing fMRI data and building a machine learning model to make predictions. We created both a XGBoost model and a neural network for this project.
